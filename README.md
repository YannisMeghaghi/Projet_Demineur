# Projet_Demineur

This project is a personnal project that i wanted to make just for fun during my first year of engineering school.
It was also for me a way to upgrade my algorithm comprehension skills with notably a using of recursivity in my code.

Every images i used were made by myself (not a big proudness) and the songs are from the video game "Counter-Strike".
